Dynamic Portfolio Website - RAW PHP

This is a portfolio website and I have done this with RAW PHP. This is my first project of backend development. I really enjoy by improving my development skills. This project is really so helpful to clear the concept of CRUD Operation. I have also know how to build logic and implement that in project and how to catch error, bugs; fix them and if need help then go to google help stackoverflow and many other websites. Actually the journey of web development is really so amazing.
